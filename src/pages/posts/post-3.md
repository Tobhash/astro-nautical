## Why Components?

- **Reusability**: Write once, use everywhere.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Keep logic and presentation organized.
- **Interoperability**: Use React, Vue, Svelte, or plain HTML components together!

## Example: Basic Astro Component

```astro
---
const { name } = Astro.props;
---
<h2>Hello, {name}!</h2>
```

## Using Framework Components

You can import and use React, Vue, or Svelte components directly:

```astro
---
import MyReactButton from '../components/MyReactButton.jsx';
---
<MyReactButton label="Click me!" />
```

## Best Practices

- Keep components small and focused.
- Use props for customization.
- Prefer `.astro` components for static content.
